Hi tavishi , I love you very much and you will come back to me soon :), 

Dear Tavishi , as I begin to write this I am at loss of words , my love for you just can't be put into words , I still find it hard to believe we are no longer together or maybe its just the fear that I might not find anyone like you , or anyone at all for that matter , but its okay , hello ,yaar my life is so sorted
